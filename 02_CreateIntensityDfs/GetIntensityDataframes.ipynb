    "# Get intensity data frames from images and masks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, raw (stitched) images and their respective segmentation masks are loaded. The script reads the images into the notebook and their dimensions are checked. \n",
    "If the dimensions are correct, the images are measured and their data is saved to data frames. The intensity values for each cell (min, mean, max) are saved, as well as cell area (in pixels) and their centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the dimensions of the images and the mask are not identical, the cells cannot be measured. \n",
    "For the data in this project, this was the case a few times. However, there was only padding missing in the bottoms of some images. This means horizontally at the bottom of the images, rows of black pixels had to be added.\n",
    "This script allows for that to happen, if necessary.\n",
    "If the dimensions are not the same for any other reason, the padding code in this script is not appropriate for fixing the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the data frames, they are saved to the data folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "Please run this script cell-by-cell. No modifications should be required. However, please make sure that the directory structure is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "This script is initialised with the variable roi, which decides the name of the sample image to be measured.\n",
    "In this script, the correct name of the image available as example data is already assigned to the roi variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script requires a labelled segmentation mask as input, which should be saved in \"00_Data/NucleiCytoMasks\". It also takes stitched preprocessed multiplexed stained images as input from the folder \"00_Data/PP_Images\".\n",
    "All images and masks should be the exact same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input files should be .tif files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "This script saves one data frame for each biomarker-stained input image to \"00_Data/IntensityDataFrames/\" as csv files."
